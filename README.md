# _printf  This is a prototype for the  implementation of (_printf). As you can see, this prototype is an implementation of the **printf standard function** and **variadic function** .

## What is printf? "Writes the C string pointed by _format_ to the standard output ([stdout](http://www.cplusplus.com/stdout))" - [cplusplus](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/) 

In other words, the function receives a format (*const char* **format*) and a list of arguments (the magic of variadic functions). So printf inside, take the string format and search for specific patterns, then the pattern that was found it is passed to other function that prints the match pattern.
